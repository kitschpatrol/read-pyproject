## Getting started

### Dependencies

Node 20.19.0+

### Installation

#### Local

```sh
npm install read-pyproject
```

### Quick Start

```ts
import { readPyproject } from 'read-pyproject'

// Get a strictly typed and normalized representation of pyproject.toml
const parsedPyproject = await readPyproject('/path/to/project', 'passthrough')

// Log the object
console.log(parsedPyproject)
```

## Usage

### API

### Examples

## Background

### Motivation

I wanted something like [read-pkg](https://github.com/sindresorhus/read-pkg) or [pkg-types](https://github.com/unjs/pkg-types), but with support for `pyproject.toml` files.

It's a bit strange to work across language ecosystems like this, but I had occasion to do so for some other Node-based projects related to project metadata extraction, specifically [@kitschpatrol/codemeta](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/codemeta) and [metascope](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/metascope).

### Implementation notes

The project consists of a number of Zod schemas responsible for mapping, and normalizing data found in a `pyproject.toml` a nicely typed JavaScript object.

Forcing the rather dynamic and extensible data structure found in `pyproject.toml` into a TypeScript straightjacket is likely futile, but an LLM makes the project at least somewhat tractable.

## Maintainers

@kitschpatrol

## Slop factor

_High._

An initial human-crafted specification was implemented by Claude Code. The output has been subject to only moderate post-facto human scrutiny.
