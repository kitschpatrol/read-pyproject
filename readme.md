**Parse and normalize pyproject.toml metadata into strictly typed JavaScript objects.**

<!-- /short-description -->

## Overview

A typed [`pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/) reader for Node.js.

Highlights:

- **Typed output**\
  The returned object is deeply typed via Zod schema inference, giving you autocomplete and type safety for `[project]`, `[build-system]`, `[dependency-groups]`, and 30+ `[tool.*]` sections.

- **Normalized keys**\
  TOML's mix of `kebab-case`, `snake_case`, and `PascalCase` keys are all converted to `camelCase` in the output. PEP 503 package name normalization is applied to `project.name`, with the original preserved as `rawName`.

- **Flexibly strict**\
  Control how unknown keys are handled with three modes: `'passthrough'` (default, keeps everything), `'strip'` (silently removes unknown keys), or `'error'` (throws on unknown keys).

- **Broad tool coverage**\
  Typed schemas for 30+ common `[tool.*]` sections. Unrecognized tools pass through as `unknown` by default.

Note that this library currently only _reads_, it does not write changes back to the `.toml` file.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

[Node](https://nodejs.org/) 20.19.0+

### Installation

```sh
npm install read-pyproject
```

### Quick start

```ts
import { readPyproject } from 'read-pyproject'

const pyproject = await readPyproject('/path/to/project')

console.log(pyproject.project?.name) // Normalized PEP 503 name
console.log(pyproject) // The rest of the object...
```

## Usage

### API

#### `readPyproject(pathOrDirectory?, unknownKeyPolicy?)`

Read, parse, validate, and normalize a `pyproject.toml` file.

##### Parameters

- `pathOrDirectory` — A file path or directory. If a directory, appends `/pyproject.toml`. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
- `unknownKeyPolicy` — How to handle unknown keys: `'passthrough'` (default), `'strip'`, or `'error'`.

##### Returns

`Promise<PyprojectData>`

##### Throws

`PyprojectError` on missing files, invalid TOML, or validation failures (in `'error'` mode).

##### Examples

```ts
import { readPyproject } from 'read-pyproject'

// Read from current directory
await readPyproject()

// Read from a specific file
await readPyproject('/path/to/pyproject.toml')

// Read from a directory
await readPyproject('/path/to/project')

// Reject unknown keys
await readPyproject('/path/to/project', 'error')

// Strip unknown keys from the output
await readPyproject('/path/to/project', 'strip')
```

#### `PyprojectError`

Custom error class thrown for file read errors, TOML parse errors, and validation failures. Includes a `filePath` property for context.

#### `setLogger(logger?)`

Inject a custom logger. Accepts a [LogLayer](https://github.com/theogravity/loglayer) instance or a `Console`-like object.

### Normalization

- All kebab-case and snake_case keys in the TOML are converted to camelCase in the output.

- `project.name` is normalized per [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/#normalized-names) (lowercased, runs of `[-_.]+` collapsed to a single `-`). The original name is available as `project.rawName`.

- `project.readme` is normalized to a string when the readme is file-based (`"README.md"` stays as-is, `{ file: "README.md", content-type: "..." }` collapses to `"README.md"`). Inline-text readmes (`{ text: "...", content-type: "..." }`) are kept as a `{ text, contentType? }` object.

- `project.license` is normalized from an SPDX string (`"MIT"`) to `{ spdx }`, validated and corrected via [spdx-correct](https://github.com/jslicense/spdx-correct.js). Legacy table-form licenses (`{ file }` or `{ text }`) pass through as-is.

### Supported `[tool.*]` sections

The following tools have typed schemas. Unknown tools pass through as `unknown` by default.

autopep8, bandit, black, bumpversion, check-wheel-contents, cibuildwheel, codespell, comfy, commitizen, coverage, dagster, distutils, docformatter, flake8, flit, hatch, isort, jupyter-releaser, mypy, pdm, pixi, poe, poetry, pydocstyle, pylint, pyright, pytest, ruff, setuptools, setuptools_scm, tbump, towncrier, uv, yapf

## Background

### Motivation

I wanted something like [read-pkg](https://github.com/sindresorhus/read-pkg) or [pkg-types](https://github.com/unjs/pkg-types), but for `pyproject.toml` files.

It's a bit strange to work across language ecosystems like this, but I had occasion to do so for some other Node-based projects related to project metadata extraction, specifically [@kitschpatrol/codemeta](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/codemeta) and [metascope](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/metascope).

### Implementation notes

The project consists of a number of [Zod](https://zod.dev) schemas responsible for mapping and normalizing data found in a `pyproject.toml` into a nicely typed JavaScript object.

Forcing the rather dynamic and extensible data structure found in `pyproject.toml` into a TypeScript straightjacket is likely futile, but an LLM makes the project at least somewhat tractable.

## Slop factor

_High._

An initial human-crafted specification was implemented by LLM. The output has been subject to only moderate post-facto human scrutiny.
